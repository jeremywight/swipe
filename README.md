# swipe
React Native Swipe Gesture Boostrap App

This app is a start at learning advanced swiping animations (similar to Tinder) through the Advanced React Native Udemy course


To start the app cd into the `swipe` dir and run 
(This app leverages Expo, if you do not have expo-cli installed this will prompt you to install expo globally)

`npm start`

This should start the expo environment, from which you can trigger the starting of the iOS or Android Simulator. Especially for Android this app is best used on a physical device due to animation, which you can get from scanning the QR Code in the expo environment.
